            <h2>There's a lot to love about this classic whiskey and bitters beverage. The official drink of New
                Orleans,
                the
                Sazerac is every bit as aromatic and flavorful as most anything else from down on the bayou.</h2>
            <em><p>This cocktail tastes like whiskey! That, and a little bit of sweetness from the sugar mixed with a few
                herbal,
                bitter
                notes from the Peychaud's and the Herbsaint. But really, this is a very <strong>whiskey-forward drink</strong>, so a good
                rye
                is
                essential to get it right.</p></em>
